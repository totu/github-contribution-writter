Script to write messages in the contribution chart

# Purpose
Be able to write arbitrary messages into Github's contribution chart, because lets face it most of the time my commit chart is just barren.

# How to
Make a script that takes in a string and path to repo. The script figures out on which days you need to make commits and makes (literal) dummy commits to make text appear.

# Spex
The commit chart is 7 by Something-wide for text to look nice let's use 5x3 letters leaving one row on top and below of a letter and one column in between.

# TODO
- [x] Figure a way to add letters
- [ ] Add all letters
- [x] Generate boolean representation of written text
- [ ] How to track days
- [ ] Figure out where to run the script
- [ ] PROFIT!
